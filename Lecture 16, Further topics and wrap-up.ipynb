    "Thanks to digitalization, data is collected in many fields. One can try to understand underlying phenomena or make forecasts based on data. The most advanced form is prescriptive (or decision) analytics, where decisions and suggestions are made based on data to meet desired objectives. For such data-driven decision support, we can formulate optimization problems based on data and solve them with appropriate (multiobjective) optimization methods. The application fields are many: ranging from forest treatment planning to forensics and inventory management to maintenance. If you are interested in analytics in practice and learning skills for making decisions based on data, this is a course for you.

    "More information: TIES5830 Data-driven optimization and decision making is a master level (advanced) course in mathematical information technology (tietotekniikka in Finnish) (applicable also for doctoral students) where the emphasis is on solving data-driven optimization problems. We cover various aspects: problems where we have to solely rely on past data with no new information, problems where new information comes at a large cost, real-life applications, and supporting human decision-makers in choosing the best solution. The course is suitable e.g., as an optional MSc course in computational sciences and the thematic module on decision analytics. The course introduces various optimization methods and software with some theoretical foundations. In addition, many practical examples will be considered demonstrating the potential of multiobjective optimization tools. Different challenges of practical problems are also addressed, including visualizing the relevant information to support the decision maker. The course is a project-based course, supported with lectures, assignments and discussion sessions. The students can choose the topic, application area, and data for the project. \n",
